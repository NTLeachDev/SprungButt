# SprungButt

Was bored so I figured I'd start a very derivative, basic, and poorly written Dependency Injection Framework.

I'll probably never finish the functionality that I have in mind but whatever.

Forget @Bean/@Component/@Service/@Repository, they're all just @Thing's

Forget @Configuration, it's really just @ThingSetup

Forget @Autowired, it's really just @InjectThings

Forget @Value, it's really (simplified) just @GetProperty

Setter Injection? Never heard of her

Member variables injected into config classes? Not yet

Multiple Things of the same type? Not yet

Proxy Based? Not yet, and even then, only when needed; there's not even AOP functionality to use proxies yet

Will I force the use of Dynamic Proxies, and thereby force the use of interfaces for any AOP relevant stuff? Depends on how I feel but probably
